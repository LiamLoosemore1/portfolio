**Professional profile**

I am an enthusiastic hard working young man I left school on 15 th June 2018. I have had a bit of work experience; however, I am a quick learner and I put one hundred percent effort into everything I do. I can come across as shy. This is something I need to work on, I feel like adventuring in to working life will help me gain much needed confidence.
I have a foundation diploma in Games and Software Development currently working towards an extended diploma at college I will achieve this June 2020.
